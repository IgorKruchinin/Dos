# Dos
My program sources for DOS (I compiling this with Borland C++)

RANDBEEP sends signals or double signals from the system speaker at random intervals within the specified intervals

LISTS is my simple realisation of singly linked lists with main function for test

MTRPLUS outputs random numbers for summation and asks the user to enter the sum of the numbers output by the program, and then checks the correctness of the answer entered by the user

STIMER is a simple timer that gives time for getting ready, then sends a signal via system speaker, then begins countdown to specified time, then sends a double signal and exits
